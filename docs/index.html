				<h2>Help</h2>
				<p>This bot provides a <code>/hentai search &lt;board&gt; &lt;tags&gt; &lt;hidden&gt;</code> slash-command, which requires an image board and one or more tags to be specified.</p>
				<p>There is an optional <code>hidden</code> flag, which when set to <strong>Yes</strong> will make the response visible to only the user that executed the command.</p>
				<p>For user convinence, the image board is choosable from a list, and the tags auto-complete while typing just like on the boards themselves.</p>
				<p>Once the initial response is shown, browsing of other images with the same tags is available using the buttons underneath the message.</p>

				<h2>Source</h2>
				<p>The code for this bot and website is open-source, available for download from its <a href="https://github.com/viral32111/hentai">GitHub repository</a>. It is licensed under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">GNU Affero General Public License v3.0</a>.</p>

				<h2>Privacy</h2>
				<p>No personal user information is collected, processed, or stored by the Discord bot. This can be verified by checking the source code.</p>
				<p>When interacting with the Discord bot via its application commands, any <a href="https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/receiving-and-responding#interaction-object">relevant data</a> is sent to the bot by Discord so that an accurate response can be returned. This data is ephemeral as it is only used for the duration of the interaction execution.</p>
				<p>When the Discord bot is undergoing development, real-time logs of incoming HTTP requests and their subsequent responses are monitored for debugging purposes. These often contain identifiable information such as IP addresses, browser user-agent strings, etc. However, as application command interactions originate from Discord's servers and not a user's client, the users of this Discord bot should not be concerned unless they are sending requests to the interaction endpoint themselves. These logs only exist for the duration of development, and are not stored thus cannot be viewed again at a later date.</p>
				<p>The Discord bot is hosted on the Cloudflare Workers platform, as such any incoming requests are subject to <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/privacypolicy/">their privacy policy</a> as well.</p>
